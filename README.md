# Propel
Propel is a web-based property management dashboard built for landlords, property managers, and real estate operators. It’s a clean, front-end–focused platform that makes managing properties, tenants, and finances straightforward and efficient. Propel prioritizes clarity, speed, and trust—no bloated tools, no cluttered workflows.

## What it does?
- Property management made simple: Add, edit, and monitor properties from a single dashboard.
- Tenant & lease tracking: View tenant details, lease status, and key dates without digging.
- Income & expense overview: Track rent, payments, and basic financial performance at a glance.
- Clear visual dashboard: See occupancy, cash flow trends, and property status instantly.

## Build timeline
- Front-End Development: Built as a modern, responsive web interface with a structured, scalable layout.
- Vibe Coding with Aura.ai: Aura.ai accelerated layout decisions, component flow, and visual consistency, keeping development fast and focused.
- Visual-First Approach: Strong emphasis on spacing, typography, soft shadows, and a refined dark UI to match premium prop-tech platforms.
- Most property management software is either outdated or painfully overcomplicated. Propel cuts through that. It’s modern, focused, and easy to use without sacrificing a professional feel. The goal is simple: help users manage properties efficiently without fighting the interface.
